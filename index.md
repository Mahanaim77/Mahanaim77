We are a Hispanic congregation who has been study the Hebraic insights in the Bible!(Tanakh and Brit hachadasha) for more than 10 years already. We give praise to the Almighty G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and embrace Yeshua (Yahshua) as our Messiah. 
Who we are
Throughout the entire Holy Scriptures, Genesis to Revelation, Elohim has promised to gather in His people from the four corners of the world and bring them back to Him and to the truth of His Word. He is doing this in our day through the precious sacrifice of our beloved Messiah, Yeshua, who said in Matthew 15: 24 that He came for the lost sheep of Israel. We are some of those sheep. We are part of the nation of Israel that was scattered long ago and we are a partial fulfillment of the many prophecies that Elohim’s people would return to His Holy ways in the last days. We come from many, mostly Spanish speaking, nations, so our primary language is Spanish, with many of our members speaking English and our service is translated into English for those who do not speak Spanish. We welcome all believers in Yeshua who want to walk in His ways and learn His teachings. 
Our beliefs
We believe in Elohim (God), The Creator of The Universe, He is The Great I AM; The Elohim of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and the Elohim of Israel and the Jewish People. The Jewish Messiah We believe that Yeshua (Jesus) is The Jewish Messiah, the Son of Elohim, and that He is Elohim who manifested Himself in the flesh as a Jew to Israel in order to fulfill the Messianic Prophecies, to show us The Father, to completely interpret His Torah, and to show us how to walk in righteous obedience to  our creator. We believe that we express our love and devotion to Yeshua by walking in the ways of Torah as He told us in John 14:15, “If you love me you will keep my Torah (commandments).”

What we study
We believe in the totality of Elohim’s Word, His Holy Torah (The Five Books of Moses) and the Prophets and Writings (Old Testament) (Tanakh) and in The New Testament, which are The Apostolic Writings. Ps 33:4

AMI ISRAEL JAI! My people Israel live! Mi pueblo Israel vive!
